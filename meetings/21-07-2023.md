## Notes

1. Round Table
   - Donny:
     - No updates
     - In winter, will be teaching an advanced AI course
       - Wants to integrate DACCS in the course
       - Looking for datasets and workflows
   - Francis:
     - Reviewing PR requests
   - Alex:
     - WPS page layout done
     - Working on issues from previous feedback (node logos too big in mobile)
     - Upcoming work: 
       - dynamic page to show which service is available at which node
       - Colour palette (use WPS page as testing ground)
       - Banner image
       - Images for Weaver page (climate analytics images?)
       - Animation for Weaver page (to show workflows being uploaded and results returned)
     - Website demo ready by 1st or 2nd week of August?
     - goal to lauch DACCS website in September?
   - Deepak:
     - Managing data on UofT DACCS node
2. Software Architecture
   - Minimal subset of components for a Node:
     - Defining minimum requirements for a DACCS node is important and the requirements should be made strict
     - At the very least Magpie and Twitcher should be required because they are used for authorization
     - At the very least one entry point into the node. Currently, this is Jupyter Lab for now
     - Some nodes just provide a catalog and their entry point is an API.
     - Further discussion is required
3. Potential Risks
4. Federation Decision
5. Opportunities for Growth
6. Other Topics
- DACCS Network name: 
  - Proposed names: Marble and Glacier
    - Francis has the same reservations about Glacier being too winter themed
    - Donny agrees with Francis
    - No one has any objections to Marble
    - Email will be sent to those who couldnâ€™t attend the meeting to get their vote
