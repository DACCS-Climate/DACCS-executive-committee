3. Potential Risks
4. Federation Decision
5. Opportunities for Growth
   - OSPD talks:
     - we should demonstrate how to do a basic data retrieval and analysis
       - as a jupyter notebook
     - Question: is what we're doing on Marble everything that they're looking for?
       - Answer: (David's personal opinion): this is a pretext to get platform maintainers to ensure that we can all use
         each other's services.
     - Question: do we need to update weaver to be compliant
       - Answer: OGC-API test suite has been released recently, and we should run it to check if we are compliant
     - Question: how does authentication work?
       - Answer: we should ask about it
