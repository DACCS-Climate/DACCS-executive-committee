     - They want to use Marble as a backend for their research
     - Question:
       - Can an organization create a product that uses a Marble node as a backend and charge users for the service
         - It's up to the individual node owner to decide how to block/throttle access to their own node
         - We will check 
   - node at physics at UofT is in progress, they are possibly buying a new server
   - work packages for students this summer
     - best practices for data ingestion
     - best practices for publishing data
       - Francis: suggest using STAC and weaver to define workflows that generated the data
   - meta variables for STAC search
     - Francis: variables are defined in extensions, extensions should not support duplicate variable names in theory
       but there is no central authority/standard that enforces this.
   - work on bug fixes for birdhouse
