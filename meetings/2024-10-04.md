## Notes

1. Round Table
   - David: 
      - creating new extension for STAC-populator
      - has been running into annoying issues about extending current implementation
      - we should be able to subclass an abstract implementation class
      - the json schema validations that are available for the stac extensions are not sufficient
         - eg: they include variables that are specific to ESGF
         - we need a separate layer so that we can customize the publicly available extensions for our purposes 
   - Maximo: 
      - leaving CRIM next week :(
   - Francis: 
      - mostly working on weaver
      - discussion with Ouranos about hosting docker images on Dockerhub (pricing changes)
         - David: we are requesting open-source pricing for next year
   - Steve:
      - still waiting to hear back from CFI
      - talked with UofT building group (HVAC) and asked to create an hourly projection on heating and cooling degree days from CMIP
         - David: Ouranos might have a relevant dataset
         - James: https://services.pacificclimate.org/wx-files/app/
   - James:
      - Eric has stepped down so PCIC is mostly just on maintenance work for the moment
      - Before he left, Eric worked on some notebooks for selecting a section for downscaling on a map
      - Question: is anyone planning on applying for DRAC funding (PCIC is applying)
         - Steve: we don't have a clear proposal so no we won't apply
      - Question (Maximo): is PCIC still using CFI funds
         - James: I'm not sure
   - Misha: 
      - Installing EO data on our server and working on creating STAC catalog entries for those
      - Working on purchasing a new GPU-enabled server for UofT
